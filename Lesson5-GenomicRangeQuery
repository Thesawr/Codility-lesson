Task description
A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G and T, which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide has an impact factor, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types A, C, G and T have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going to answer several queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?

The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N characters. There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers. The K-th query (0 ≤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).

For example, consider string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:

    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6
The answers to these M = 3 queries are as follows:

The part of the DNA between positions 2 and 4 contains nucleotides G and C (twice), whose impact factors are 3 and 2 respectively, so the answer is 2.
The part between positions 5 and 5 contains a single nucleotide T, whose impact factor is 4, so the answer is 4.
The part between positions 0 and 6 (the whole string) contains all nucleotides, in particular nucleotide A whose impact factor is 1, so the answer is 1.
Write a function:

class Solution { public int[] solution(String S, int[] P, int[] Q); }

that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters and two non-empty arrays P and Q consisting of M integers, returns an array consisting of M integers specifying the consecutive answers to all queries.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given the string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:

    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6
the function should return the values [2, 4, 1], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
M is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
each element of arrays P, Q is an integer within the range [0..N − 1];
P[K] ≤ Q[K], where 0 ≤ K < M;
string S consists only of upper-case English letters A, C, G, T.

// you can also use imports, for example:
// import java.util.*;

// you can write to stdout for debugging purposes, e.g.
// System.out.println("this is a debug message");

class Solution {
    public int[] solution(String S, int[] P, int[] Q) {
        // write your code in Java SE 8
        
        int[] result = new int[P.length];
        int[][] nucleo = new int[3][S.length()+1];
        
        for(int i=0; i<S.length(); i++)
        {
            int a = 0;
            int c = 0;
            int g = 0;
            
            if(S.charAt(i) == 'A')
                a = 1;
            else if(S.charAt(i) == 'C')
                c = 1;
            else if(S.charAt(i) == 'G')
                g = 1;
            
            nucleo[0][i+1] = nucleo[0][i] + a; 
            nucleo[1][i+1] = nucleo[1][i] + c;
            nucleo[2][i+1] = nucleo[2][i] + g;
        }
        
        for(int i=0; i<P.length; i++)
        {
            int start = P[i];
            int stop = Q[i] + 1;
            
            if(nucleo[0][stop] - nucleo[0][start] > 0)
            {
                result[i] = 1;
            }
            else if(nucleo[1][stop] - nucleo[1][start] > 0)
            {
                result[i] = 2;
            }
            else if(nucleo[2][stop] - nucleo[2][start] > 0)
            {
                result[i] = 3;
            }
            else
            {
                result[i] = 4;
            }
        }
        
        
        return result;
    }
